                                 WHAT HE DID WITH HIS LIFE AND WHEN HE WAS BORN
</P>
<P> I got this from wikipedia it says Muhammad ali was born january 17, 1943 in louisville, ky. Also Muhammad ali was an American professional boxer and activist. He is widely regarded as one of Muhammad was athletic most significant and celebrated sports figures of the 20th century.January 17, 1942, Louisville, Kentucky  Died: June 3, 2016, In 1967 two years after winning the heavyweight title Ali further antagonized the white establishment by refusing to be drafted into the U.S. military, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam War. He was eventually arrested, found guilty of draft evasion charges, and stripped of his boxing titles. Also one of his quotes was Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. Ilike that. He also was successfully appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned his conviction in 1971, by which time he had not fought for nearly four year and thereby lost a period of peak performance as an athlete. At a time when most fighters let their managers do the talking, Ali thrived in and indeed craved the spotlight, where he was often provocative and outlandish.</p> 
                                       
<P>HIS TITLES HE WON</p>
 <p> I got this from muhammadali book it say Muhammad Ali won 6 Kentucky golden gloves titles, 2  national Golden Gloves titles, an Amateur Athletic Union National Title, Muhammad ali and the Light Heavyweight gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Ali's amateur record was 100 wins with five losses.Ali was married 4 times, but not all of his children came from each wife. Two of his kids were from other relationships. When Ali married his first wife Sonji Roi, the marriage was very short and they never had kids. Ali then went on to marry his second wife Belinda Boyd, who later changed her name to Khalilah. And taunting his opponents and bragging about his own abilities, which eventually gained him a title fight against heavyweight champion Sonny Liston in 1964, Ali, known as Cassius Clay then, beat Liston and went on to be heavyweight champion for three years. As public opinion began turning people against the war and the Civil Rights Movement continued to gather momentum, Ali became a popular speaker at colleges and universities across the country; this itinerary was rare if not unprecedented for a prizefighter.

                       <p> WHAT UNIVERSITY HE WENT TO AND WHAT HE LIKE TO DO THERE</p>
                        
<p>I GOT THIS from Wikipedia it say  At Howard University, for example, he gave his popular "Black Is Best" speech to 4,000 cheering students and community intellectuals, after he was invited to speak by sociology professor Nathan Hare on behalf of the Black Power Committee, a student protest group.These early fights were not without trials. Clay was knocked down both by Sonny Banks and Cooper. In the Cooper fight, Clay was floored by a left hook  at the end of round four and was saved by the bell, going on to win in the predicted 5th round due to Cooper's severely cut eye. Also one of Ali's greatest tricks was to make opponents overcommit by pulling straight backward from punches. Disciplined, world-class boxers chased Ali and threw themselves off balance attempting to hit him because he seemed to be an open target, only missing and leaving themselves exposed to Ali's counter punches, usually a chopping rights. I also ways like how he set himself up to fight even tho i kickbox i like the way he box. And i guess thatâ€™s the end of my history story on Muhammad Ali .
